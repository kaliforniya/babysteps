    <h1>Krzysztof Eugeniusz Penderecki</h1>
    <p class="biography">Was a Polish composer and conductor. His best known works include Threnody to the Victims<br> 
        of Hiroshima, Symphony No. 3, his St Luke Passion, Polish Requiem,  and Utrenja.<br> 
        Penderecki's oeuvre includes four operas, eight symphonies and other<br> 
        orchestral pieces, a variety of instrumental concertos, choral<br> 
        settings of mainly religious texts, as well as chamber and<br> 
        instrumental works.</p>
        <h2>1959</h2>
        <p class="biography">Born in Dębica, Penderecki studied music at Jagiellonian<br> 
            University and the Academy of Music in Kraków. After<br> 
            graduating from the Academy, he became a teacher there<br> 
            and began his career as a composer in 1959 during the<br> 
            Warsaw Autumn festival.</p>
            <p class="continuation">Beginning in the mid-1970s, Penderecki's composition<br> 
                style changed, with his first violin concerto<br> 
                focusing on the semitone and the tritone. His<br> 
                choral work Polish Requiem was written in the<br> 
                1980s and expanded in 1993 and 2005.</p>

        <p class="positioned-text" id="paragraph">Krzysztof Penderecki composed between 1959 and 1968 original<br> 
            music for at least eleven documentary and feature films as<br> 
            well as for twenty-five animated films for adults and<br> 
            children. Some of Penderecki's music has been<br> 
            adapted for film soundtracks.</p>

            <p class="positioned-text" id="left-paragraph">Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980) features six pieces of Penderecki's music:<br>
                Utrenja II: Ewangelia, Utrenja II: Kanon Paschy, The Awakening of Jacob,<br> 
                De Natura Sonoris No. 1, De Natura Sonoris No. 2 and Polymorphia.<br>
                David Lynch has used Penderecki's music in the soundtracks of the<br> 
                films Wild at Heart (1990), Inland Empire (2006), and the TV<br> 
                series Twin Peaks (2017). In the film Fearless (1993) by<br> 
                Peter Weir, the piece Polymorphia was once again used<br>
                for an intense plane crash scene, seen from the point<br> 
                of view of the passenger played by Jeff Bridges.<br> 
                Penderecki's Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima<br> 
                was also used during one of the final sequences<br> 
                in the film Children of Men (2006). Penderecki<br> 
                composed music for Andrzej Wajda's 2007 Academy<br> 
                Award nominated film Katyń, while Martin Scorsese's<br> 
                Shutter Island (2010) featured his Symphony No. 3 and Fluorescences.<br>
